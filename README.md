# MiniTwitter
A Mini Twitter app using java swing that implements basic design patterns



Final Thoughts:
I was having trouble understanding the functionality of some of the design pattern in A2, which led me to create the classes in a way which somewhat resembles the patterns. The issue was that it worked well for the functionality needed in assignment 2, but was more difficult to change when I did assignment 3. When I actually needed to expand functionality, thats where it really helped me understand what these patterns are helpful for. I may have not have done these perfectly, or even correctly for that matter, but I actuallly did learn the material very well for future projects.
